Learning how to read and write JSON files

I've noticed that the data in my website very rarely changes, and as such, linking it to a database (like MongoDB in my case) is an overkill and would slow the website since it needs to connect to the DB first. As a result, I decided to migrate my data into JSON files that will reside on the website's files. This repository is me learning how to do that as efficiently as possible till this date.
